# HackBU Hackathon

A 24-hour, 200 person hackathon at Binghamton University.


## Contributing

In addition to cloning this repository, you'll need [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to edit the website.

We've written a Grunt task in `Gruntfile.js` that watches for changes in the `less/main.less`, converts it CSS, and stores the output in `css/main.css`.

Before running Grunt, `cd` into the repository and run `npm install`. Then run `grunt` to watch your `.less` files.

*Do not edit `css/main.css` directly because it will be overwritten.*
